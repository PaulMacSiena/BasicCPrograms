# BasicCPrograms  
Paul Macfarlane
This repository contains some simple C programs that I created in preparation for the course at Siena College CSIS340: Programming Languages with Dr. Jim Teresco.  

Program Descriptions:  
  
argadder.c: This program takes an arbitrary number of command-line parameters, each of which should represent an integer value and prints out the sum of the values provided.  
  
cat.c: This program performs the same function as a unix cat command.
  It displays the contents of a file, with the option to display the number of all output lines,
  number for all nonempty output lines, or no lines specified at all.  
  
cp.c: This program performs the same function as a unix cp command.
  It copies one file to another file  
  
head.c: This program performs the same function as a unix head command.
  It displays the first n (userspecified) lines of a file, or first 10 lines if user does not specify  
    
inputadder.c: This program reads in integers and displays the cummulative sum until the user exits or enters an invalid input    
inpitadder2.c: This program reads in integers and displays the cummulative sum until the user exits or enters an invalid input
  In addition, the program prints the addition problem and its solution at the end of execution.  
    
wc.c: This program performs the same function as a unix wc command.
  It displays the word count, number of lines and bytes in a particular file.  
    
Note: As with many of my public repositories on Github, this repository contains work from a private repository for a class at Siena College. If you would like access to the private repository with the original commit history and workflow, email me at pj16macf@siena.edu.
